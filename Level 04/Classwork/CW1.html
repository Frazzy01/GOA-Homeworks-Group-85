<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/"><button>steam</button></a> is a digital distribution service and storefront developed by Valve. It was
launched as a software client in September 2003 to provide video game updates
automatically for Valve's games and expanded to distributing third-party titles in late
2005. Steam offers various features, such as game server matchmaking with Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC)
measures, social networking, and game streaming services. The Steam client functions 
include update maintenance, cloud storage, and community features such as direct
messaging, an in-game overlay, discussion forums, and a virtual collectable marketplace.
The storefront also offers productivity software, game soundtracks, videos, and sells hardware made by Valve, 
such as the Valve Index and the Steam Deck.
