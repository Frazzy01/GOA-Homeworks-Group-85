            <h3 id="discord" style="color: purple;"><b>discord</b> Discord is an instant messaging and VoIP social platform 
                that allows communication through voice calls,
                video calls, text messaging, and media. 
                Communication can be private or in virtual communities called "servers".
                [note 2] A server is a collection of persistent 
                chat rooms and voice channels accessed by invitation links. 
                Discord runs on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, iPadOS, Linux, and in web browsers.</h3>

            <h3 style="font-size: 64px; background-color: blueviolet;">Discord was conceived by Jason Citron, 
                who founded OpenFeint, a social gaming platform for mobile games, 
                and Stanislav Vishnevskiy, who founded Guildwork, another social gaming platform. 
                Citron sold OpenFeint to GREE in 2011 for US$104 million, which he used to found Hammer & Chisel, 
                a game development studio, in 2012. Their first product was Fates Forever, released in 2014, 
                which Citron anticipated to be the first multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game on mobile platforms, 
                but it was not commercially successful.</h3>

                An application (app, application program, software application) 
                is any program that can be categorized as application software.
                Application is a subjective classification that is often used to differentiate from system and utility software.
