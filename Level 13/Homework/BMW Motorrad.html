        <p><center><b>History</b></center></p>

        <h3>The company began as an aircraft engine manufacturer in the early 20th century and through World War I. BMW manufactured its first motorcycle in 1923, the R32, which featured a flat-twin boxer engine. BMW Motorrad still uses the flat-twin boxer configuration, but now manufactures motorcycles with a variety of engine configurations.</h3>

        <p><center><b>Current production</b></center></p>

        <h3>Most BMW Motorrad's motorcycle production takes place at its plant in Berlin, Germany. The G 310 and F 450 series are produced at TVS' plant in Hosur, Tamil Nadu, India, the C 400 series is produced at Loncin's plant in Chongqing, China, while the plants in Manaus, Brazil and Rayong, Thailand produce a variety of models for the local markets. Some engines are manufactured in Austria, China, and Taiwan. Most of the current motorcycles in BMW Motorrad's range were designed by David Robb, who was the company's chief designer from 1993 to 2012 when he was replaced by Edgar Heinrich.

        The most popular model is the R1300GS and its sibling R1300GS Adventure. Current production includes a variety of shaft and chain driven models, with engines from 310 cc to 1,802 cc; and models designed for off-road, dual-purpose, sport, and touring activities.

        In 2008, BMW introduced the DOHC Boxer HP2 Sport, and entered the serious off-road competition motorcycle market with the release of the BMW G450X motorcycle.
