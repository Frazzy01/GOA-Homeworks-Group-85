            <h3>A motorcycle (motorbike, bike, or, 
                if three-wheeled, a trike) 
                is a two or three-wheeled motor vehicle steered 
                by a handlebar from a saddle-style seat.

                Motorcycle designs vary greatly to suit 
                a range of different purposes: 
                long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport (including racing), 
                and off-road riding. 
                Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other 
                related social activities such as joining a motorcycle club and 
                attending motorcycle rallies.</h3>

            In the 21st century, the motorcycle industry is mainly 
            dominated by Indian and Japanese motorcycle companies. 
            In addition to the large capacity motorcycles, 
            there is a large market in smaller capacity (less than 300 cc) 
            motorcycles, mostly concentrated in Asian and African 
            countries and produced in China and India.
            A Japanese example is the 1958 Honda Super Cub, which 
            went on to become the biggest selling vehicle of all time, 
            with its 60 millionth unit produced in April 2008. Today, 
            this area is dominated by mostly Indian companies with Hero 
            MotoCorp emerging as the world's largest manufacturer of two wheelers. 
            Its Splendor model has sold more than 8.5 million to date. 
            Other major producers are Bajaj and TVS Motors.
