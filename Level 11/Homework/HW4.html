    <h4>Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (Georgian: ხვიჩა კვარაცხელია pronounced born 12 February 2001) is a Georgian professional footballer who plays as a left winger for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Georgia national team. Regarded as one of the best wingers in the world and one of the greatest Georgian players of all time, he is known for his dribbling, agility, and playmaking.

    Kvaratskhelia started his senior career playing for Dinamo Tbilisi at age 16, before departing to Rustavi where he spent half a season. During his combined three-year tenure at Lokomotiv Moscow and Rubin Kazan, Kvaratskhelia won two consecutive Russian Premier League Best Young Player awards. Following a short spell at Dinamo Batumi, Kvaratskhelia signed for Napoli in 2022, and in his debut season helped the club to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the first time ever, and win a first Serie A title in 33 years, finishing as the league's top assist provider. This saw him named Serie A Most Valuable Player and the Champions League's Young Player of the Season.

    After two-and-a-half years at Napoli, Kvaratskhelia joined French side PSG for €70 million in January 2025. He immediately became a focal player, as the club won a continental treble in his first season at the club; Kvaratskhelia scored in the Champions League final. He also won a second Serie A title having contributed to Napoli's title success in the first half of the same season.

    Kvaratskhelia established himself for Georgia in all national youth teams, becoming a key player under different managers. He then became an integral part of the senior team after making his debut in 2019, and helped Georgia qualify for UEFA Euro 2024, the country's first ever major international tournament.</h4>
